### 2013
My last year of college is what i consider to be the first year of my career. I completed a double major in math and economics at Trinity University. I also had a summer internship at the San Antonio branch of the Dallas federal reserve bank, working with Keith Richards on a paper related to the consumer price index. 

### 2014
I graduated from an internship at a branch bank to a full time job at the federal reserve board of governors in Washington DC. My role was research assistant, and i helped economists with various papers and reports. 

### 2015
The next year i was promoted to senior research assistant, which is more or less the same thing with a fancier title. I also completed a theoretical math course at George Washington university in anticipation of applying to graduate schools. 

### 2016
I never did apply to those schools, I completely lost interest in economics and decided to become a programmer. I took some time off to travel in Spain and Africa, and then attended the recurse center in NYC. 

### 2017
I began my programming career working for a variety of different startups. First I worked as a contractor at the now-defunct BoutiqueMate, which was a booking website for boutique hotels. After that, I moved to Portland, Oregon for a job at Carevoyance working on an Angular app to help connect medical device salespeople to the right doctors. After Brexit caused an acquisition deal to fall through, Carevoyance fell on hard times and laid off our entire engineering team. A few months later I landed a job at motorized precision, a startup that retrofits welding robots for the motion picture industry. Though wildly underqualified, I worked alone on the frontend of an app which movie makers used to control the robot. 

### 2018
After my first year at MP, I began participating more actively on the film side of the business. I learned to operate the forklift, set up for a shoot, and even operated the robot for a few commercials. I began engaging more with the backend, adding support for a mechanical turntable and fixing some bugs. With business picking up, we hired a few more developers and I became the frontend lead. However, I got tired of long hours and low pay, and began reaching out to recruiters. 

I landed a job at Ubiquiti Networks.

### 2020 
In my first year at Wild Me, I led an effort to rebrand the organization and professionalize our online presence. I worked with a pro-bono designer to get a new logo approved, redesign wildme.org, and launch new websites for community engagement and documentation. This year I also designed much of Codex. 

### 2021 
With backend development on Codex in full swing, I began to dedicate most of my time to writing the frontend. For most of the year I did this alone, but toward the end of the year I was joined by another programmer. During this year I also prepared the initial designs for a product called Scout, designed to assist with aerial wildlife surveys. 

### 2022 
After hiring an additional frontend developer to work on the Codex frontend, I began dedicating serious time to the development of Scout. In the summer we released Codex to the public and began the process of sunsetting Wildbook, one conservation community at a time. In 2022 we managed to migrate Zebras, Seals, and ...
